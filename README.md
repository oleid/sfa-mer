Sailfish/Mer image build scripts
--------------------------------

The set of scripts aims to help preparing Sailfish/Mer images for the Sony Xperia Z pocket computer in a clean, easy and reprodicible way. They are mostly based on https://github.com/dmt4/sfa-mer.
While I use them for my builds of the yuga images, they should be usable for any device, if you put the nessecary information to the folder device/$VENDOR.

## Instructions

  - Read the scripts starting from fullbuild.sh and try to understand what goes on and why! Description of the accepted options is printed by `fullbuild.sh -h`.

  - Backup ~/.hadk.env, ~/.mersdk.profile and ~/.mersdkubu.profile if you want to keep them. They will be overwriten!

  - Make sure the .sh files are executable and start the 'fullbuild.sh' script. After a shortwhile it will ask for the root password to enter the Mer chroot.

  - If all goes suffessfull, after an hour or so, a freshly baked image shall appear in the current working directory.

  - The scrips below fullbuild.sh, responsible for the different activities, can be executed in standalone mode after initial fullbuild.sh, to repeat certain parts of the build. Of these, ahal.sh, build-img.sh and the combined hal-mw-and-img.sh are probably most useful. Each script contains a short description in its heading.


## Notes

  - If you have ~/.scratchbox2 it will be autobacked up to ~/.scratchbox2-$(date +%d-%m-%Y.%H-%M-%S) .

  - After successfull build the different scripts can be used manually intependently to update certain parts of the build. However they are not ducumented yet.

  - Repeated execution of the script is intended to only update the sources and rebuild the differences, the middleware and the image.

  - Before running the script ensure git is installed on the host, and your details are setup
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```

  - If building hybris-hal in parallel mode fails, try "-jobs 1" (see example below).
